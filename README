json-pivot
Greg Benison, August 2011

Rearrange a JSON input stream to bring certain elements to the forefront,
while preserving the relationships contained in the JSON input.  Can be
used to easily extract certain elements from deep within a JSON structure
without having to understand that JSON structure.

This project is the result of API Hack day in Portland, Oregon,
in July 2011.  The concept is described more fully here:

Dependencies: a guile json parser, such as the one found here:
git://github.com/ihh/guile-json.git

Example usage:

(use-modules (json-pivot))
(json:pivot (node:key? "votes")
	    (current-input-port)
	    (current-output-port))
