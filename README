json-pivot
Greg Benison, August 2011

Rearrange a JSON input stream to bring certain elements to the forefront,
while preserving the relationships contained in the JSON input.  Can be
used to easily extract certain elements from deep within a JSON structure
without having to understand that JSON structure.

Dependencies: a guile json parser, such as the one found here:
git://github.com/ihh/guile-json.git

This project is the result of API Hack day in Portland, Oregon,
in July 2011.  The concept is described more fully here:
